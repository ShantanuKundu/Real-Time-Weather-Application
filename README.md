# Real-Time-Weather-Application

Description:- This project makes use of the Python programming language to design a real- time GUI based interactive Weather Application. This project is aimed to provide weather data for a large number of cities and towns, including some minor cities which are not available in other weather apps. The project uses SQLite3 as the back-end to store the fetched data for further analysis.
